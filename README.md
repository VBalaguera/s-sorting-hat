# Welcome to the sorting-hat app

Where you will know which Hogwarts' house you're destined to...

## Description:

This is a simple [Vue3](https://vuejs.org/) + [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Each user will answer 28 questions. The final result will help the sorting hat decide which Hogwarts' house the user belongs to.

After ending the game, the user can play it again... if the user chooses to...

Breathe, relax, be honest. This is not your average multiple choice quiz. There are no right or wrong answers.
